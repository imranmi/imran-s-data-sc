## DataVis Makeover

Remaking a peer’s original design by improving the clarity and aesthetics of charts by creating an alternative design.
:::

# 1. The Task

In this take-home exercise, we are required to:

-   select one of the Take-home Exercise 1 prepared by our classmates,

-   critique the submission in terms of clarity and aesthetics,

-   prepare a sketch for the alternative design by using the data visualization design principles and best practices we have learned in Lesson 1 and 2, and

-   remake the original design by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.

# 2. Data Preparation

I will follow the data preparation steps done by the original author of the selector graphs. The steps are listed below for easy reference. As this is not the focus of the exercise, I will not go into the minute details of preparation.

## 2.1 Loading R packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggrepel, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, patchwork, intsvy, ggdist, ggridges,colorspace, plotly)
```

## 2.2 Importing the Data set

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- 
  read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

## 2.3 Removing missing values and Converting data types

Rows with missing values for ESCS were removed before further analysis.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean <- stu_qqq_SG[complete.cases(stu_qqq_SG[, "ESCS"]), ]
```

CNTSCHID and CNTSTUID's data types were changed to character.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSCHID <- as.character(stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSCHID)
stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSTUID <- as.character(stu_qqq_SG_clean$CNTSTUID)
```

## 2.4 Binning Variable ESCS

The ESCS variable was binned into quantiles using the [mutate()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) and [cut()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut) function

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean <- stu_qqq_SG_clean %>%
  mutate(ESCS_recoded = cut(ESCS,breaks=quantile(ESCS,c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1)),labels=c("Very Low","Low","Medium","High"),include.lowest=TRUE))
```

## 2.5 Recoding ST004D01T (Gender) variable

Variable ST004D01T, was recoded to labels to “Female” and “Male” respectively.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
stu_qqq_SG_clean$ST004D01T <- recode(stu_qqq_SG_clean$ST004D01T, "1" = "Female", "2" = "Male")
```

# 3. Visualization Critique and Remake

The graphs created by the author will be evaluated and improvements in terms of clarity and aesthetics will be applied in the makeover.

## 3.1 General distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading

First, the author had created a data folder path to save any data files generated:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

data_folder_path <- file.path(getwd(), "data")
```

The code below uses the `instvy package` to extract the composite Means and Standard Deviations of PV values across the population of students that took the assessment.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathgeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmath_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvmathgeneral$subject <- "Math"

pvreadgeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvread_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadgeneral$subject <- "Reading"

pvsciegeneral <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscie_general",folder=data_folder_path)

pvsciegeneral$subject <- "Science"

mergedgeneral <- rbind(pvmathgeneral,pvreadgeneral,pvsciegeneral)
mergedgeneral %>% relocate(subject)
```

A plot to show the general distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores was generated using the code below.

::: panel-tabset
## The original plot

![](images/clipboard-3818993272.png)

The author had created a series of error bars across the 3 subjects to represent the distribution of Student scores across the 3 subjects.

## The code

```{r}
#| eval: false

p1<- ggplot(mergedgeneral, aes(x = subject, y = Mean,colour=subject)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),lwd=0.5,show.legend=FALSE) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point",
    shape = 18,
    size = 5,
    aes(colour=subject),
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    width = 0.5,
    size=0.8,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Scores across Math, Reading and Science across all 15-year olds who took PISA 2022 in SGP") +
  ylab("Scores") +
  xlab("Subject")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 50))+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
p1
```

| **Clarity**         | 1.  Although the original plot enables me to visualize the differences in scores across subjects, I am unclear as to which score this is showing. Is it PV1 or average of the PV values?                           | 1.  The code and subset used is not suitable to plot a **Distribution** of student scores across subjects. I will extract a new subset with all PV1 scores at the individual student level. This will then be used to plot the distribution of student scores for the different subjects. |

| **Aesthetics**      | 1.  There is already a legend on the right which identifies subjects by colour, thus making the Y axis labels seem redundant.                                                                                      | 1.  To remove the legend or Y-Axis labels, to reduce non-data ink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|                     | 2.  The scale for the X-axis is from 0 to 1000, in increments of 50. Because of the "shortness" of the error bars, the graph appears too elongated. This contributes to "extra" space and additional non-data ink. | 2.  Shorten the X-axis, or extract new data points to populate the correct range of scores.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

To annotate the mean scores onto the plot, so that we can remove the background grid lines and X-axis tick marks and reduce non-data ink.                                                                                                                                             |

|                     | 4.  Since the subjects are clearly labelled in the Y axis, the label “Subject” can be removed, to minimize non-data ink.                                                                                           | 4.

## Observation

Upon closer examination of the code used, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),
    #width = 0.5,
    #size=0.8,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
```

I would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean subject scores across subjects.
:::

Examining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(mergedgeneral)
```

The *mergedgeneral* subset table only has 3 observations and 6 variables.

::: callout-note
## Conclusion

The code and data subset used by the author will not be able to plot a **Distribution** of student scores across subjects.

I will revert to the original large data set to extract PV1 scores which are available for all students to create new plots to visualize the distribution of scores.
:::

### 3.1.2 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

![](images/clipboard-3845138551.png)

### 3.1.3 Remake

The original data sub set and plot is unable to exhibit the distribution of student scores across subjects, due to the lack of scores at an individual student level.

First, I will use the code below derive some reference lines (mean and median) for our histograms.

To populate the distribution of scores for the student cohort, I will use PV1 scores, which are available for all students.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

mean_pv1math <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1MATH)
median_pv1math <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1MATH)
mean_pv1read <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1READ)
median_pv1read <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1READ)
mean_pv1scie <- mean(stu_qqq_SG$PV1SCIE)
median_pv1scie <- median(stu_qqq_SG$PV1SCIE)

```

Next, I will use the code below and extract data points (PV1 scores) from the original large data set to create Histograms with Density plots for each subject.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

p_1 <- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1MATH)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 20, color = "black", fill='lightblue') +
  geom_density(color = "purple") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(x = "Math Scores", y = "Density") + # Change label to 'Density'

## Revised Plot

The revised plot consists of a patchwork of 3 histograms with density curves, and a combined density curve overlay for the 3 subjects.\
\
Reference lines for the mean and median scores are added to enable readers to infer the skewness of the distribution of student scores.\
\
The revised plot will enable readers to quickly infer the nature of the distributions of the subject scores for the student cohort.

## 3.2 Distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading across schools

The author has used the [`pisa.mean.pv`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [`intsvy`](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy)`package`, to obtain the composite Mean and Standard Deviation values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” for each school.

The code below generates the composite PV values.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathsch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmath_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadsch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvread_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)

pvsciesch <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"),by= "CNTSCHID", data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscie_bysch",folder=data_folder_path)

A plot to show the distribution of students performance in Math, Reading and Science scores across schools was generated using the code below.

| **Aesthetics**      | 1.

Examining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(head(pvmathsch))
```

The *pvmathsch* subset table only has 164 observations and 6 variables.

::: callout-note
## Conclusion

The data subset can only be used to visualize the mean scores per school ID.

The original graph is not of a suitable design to help readers easily and quickly understand the disparity in performances between schools.

I will use a new compact visualization to enable the reader to quickly see the differences in school performance.

### 3.2.2 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

### 3.2.3 Remake

The original plot does not enable the reader to quickly capture information from the data points.

Using the exact same data set, I will use the code below to re-make the original graph into a Bubble plots instead. I will employ color as a means to differentiate the mean scores.

I have also added reference lines to show the 10th and 90th percentile scores to help readers easily identify the schools belonging to these two opposite segments.

Lastly, I have also added annotations to help readers to quickly identify the top 5 and bottom 5 schools with the best and worst mean scores.

## Revised Plot

The use of colour can help readers quickly differentiate the scores between schools.\
\
I have annotated school IDs for the top and bottom 5 schools for readers to quickly identify the "best" and "worst" schools.

I have also added reference lines for the 10th and 90th Percentile. Here we can quickly see that while most of the 164 schools attain the same range of mean scores, there are a number of schools that outperform the rest.

Annotating all the 164 school IDs will add too much ink to the plot. Hence, we can consider having another interactive plot (below) for readers to examine the data points in more detail at their descretion.
:::

For interactivity, I have used `ggplotly()` to convert this to an interactive graph. With the added interactivity, readers can use the tooltip function to get more information on the data points.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(plotly)

# Convert to an interactive plot
ggplotly(p1, tooltip = c("x", "y"))
```

::: callout-note
## Note

Some of the previous annotations generated in the static plot may not appear after turning it into an interactive plot. Hence, we can use both static and interactive plots together if needed. For example, static charts to quickly summarize and communicate information to reader, and an interactive plot for readers to drill down in more detail, eg use of zoom, identifying specific data points via tooltip etc.

## 3.3 Distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading by gender

The author had used the [`pisa.mean.pv`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [`intsvy`](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy) package to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” for each gender.

The code below was used to generate the composite PV values for Math, Reading and Science by gender.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathgenderonly <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"),c("ST004D01T"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmath_bygenderonly",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadgenderonly <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"),c("ST004D01T"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvread_bygenderonly",folder=data_folder_path)

pvsciegenderonly <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"),c("ST004D01T"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscie_bygenderonly",folder=data_folder_path)
```

A plot to display the distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores by gender was generated using the code below.

## The Original plot

## Observation

upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ST004D01T),
    #width = 0.5,
    #size=0.8,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
```

The original data set and plot is instead comparing the mean subject scores across different genders.
:::

Examining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(pvmathgenderonly)
```

The *pvmathgenderonly* data set only has 2 observations and 6 variables.

::: callout-note
## Conclusion

This data set can only be used to compare the overall mean scores for genders across the 3 subjects.

The visualization needs to be done differently to enable the reader to obtain more information regarding the performance between genders.

I will extract a new subset and create new graphs to show the range and distribution of scores between the genders across subjects.

I will use PV1 scores which are available for all students to create new plots to visualize the distribution of scores.

### 3.3.2 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

![](images/clipboard-800776571.png)

### 3.3.3 Remake

The original data subset and plot is unable to exhibit the range and distribution of subject scores across genders, due to the lack of scores at an individual student level.

Therefore, I will extract data from the original data set to create new subsets for the new plots using the code below.

In terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which are available for all students.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Create a subset of the data with gender and PV1 score columns
subset_gender_PV1 <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  select(ST004D01T, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)

# Convert the "ST004D01T" column to a factor 
subset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T <- factor(subset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Female", "Male"))

Math_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1MATH, removing NA values
  )

Read_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1READ, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1READ, removing NA values
  )

SCIE_gender <- subset_gender_PV1 %>%
  group_by(ST004D01T) %>%  # Group by gender column
  summarise(
    Freq = n(),             # Count the frequency of each gender
    Mean = mean(PV1SCIE, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the mean of PV1SCIE, removing NA values
  )
```

Next, I will use the code below to create new box plots for each subject. This will show the range of scores for the genders in different subjects.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"


# Create the plot using the subset_data

## Revised Plot

The revised plot consists of a patchwork of ridgeline plots and box plots for each subject.

The ridgeline plot been further segmented into 4 quantiles, differentiated by colour. This not only provides insights into the distribution of the scores but also enables readers to quickly understand the differences in performance between genders.

The box plots, further help readers to understand the differences in scores between genders. The range of scores can be seen along with the mean scores.

## 3.4 Distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores by socioeconomic status

The author had previously created a new variable, “ESCS_recoded”, which bins the socio-economic (ESCS) score into four quantiles - “Very Low”, “Low”, “Medium” and “High”. The author had used the [`pisa.mean.pv`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [`intsvy`](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy)`package` to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” and grouped by the ESCS score.

The code below was used to generate the composite PV values for Math, Reading and Science.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

pvmathescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"MATH"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvmathescs",folder=data_folder_path)

pvreadescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"READ"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvreadescs",folder=data_folder_path)

pvscieescs <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0("PV",1:10,"SCIE"),c("ESCS_recoded"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name="pvscieescs",folder=data_folder_path)
```

A plot to display the distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores across schools by socioeconomic status was generated using the code below.

## The Original plot

![](images/clipboard-1075189504.png)

The author had created a series of error bars to represent the scores across the 4 categories of the ESCS score (High, Medium, Low, Very Low).

#| eval: false

ggplot(pvscieescs, aes(x = ESCS_recoded, y = Mean,fill=ESCS_recoded))+

## Observation

Upon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.

```{r}
#geom_errorbar(
    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ESCS_recoded),
    #width = 0.5,
    #size=1,
    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)
```

Hence the original plot can only be used to compare the mean subject scores across different ESCS segments.
:::

Examining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.

```{r}
print(pvscieescs)
```

The data subset used for the plots only has 4 observations and 6 variables.

::: callout-note
## Conclusion

This subset and the code used is not able to plot the range of scores per ESCS segment, and can only be used to compare the composite mean scores of each of the 4 ESCS segments.

Although it is useful to compare the mean scores between different ESCS segments, a different set of data and plots can be used instead to communicate more information about the strength or weakness of the relationship between subject scores and socioeconomic statuses.
:::

Additionally, the **binning** of the ESCS score, while helpful may be limited in usefulness, for the following reasons:-

-   Binning the ESCS scores adds in an element of subjectivity. For example, why should there be 4 segments of socioeconomic statuses instead of 3, or 6?

-   Could the number of socioeconomic segments be applicable for other countries? For example, would a "Low segment" in Singapore be equivalent to a "Low segment" in another country?

### 3.4.2 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

![](images/clipboard-3423147912.png)

### 3.4.4 Remake

Instead of binning the ESCS score and transforming it to a categorical type, I will keep the ESCS score as a continuous variable.

I will use scatter plots to visualize the strength or weaknesses of the relationships between the socioeconomic statuses and subject scores.

Drawing inspiration from Prof Kam's [Lesson 3](https://isss608-ay2023-24jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson03_outline) and well as additional useful references, I will proceed to plot [Scatter plots with Marginal Histograms.](https://things-about-r.tumblr.com/post/124004085689/scatter-plots-with-marginal-densities-an-example)

In terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which at the individual student level.

For this visualization, I will use the [ggstatplot package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggstatsplot/index.html). [@patil2021]

For more information on this package and how it can be used to create graphics from statistical tests included in the plots themselves, please [refer to this link.](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03167)

```{r}
library(ggstatsplot)
```

Creating new data subset for visualization.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

  select(ESCS, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)

#omiting NA values
subset_ESCS_PV1 <- na.omit(subset_ESCS_PV1)
```

We will use the code below from `ggstatplot package` to generate the plot.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

## Revised Plot

The benefit of this plot is that it shows both the correlation between the two continous variables as well as their respective distributions, and includes important statistics like the Pearson coefficient.

From the plot above, the pearson coefficient of 0.42 indicates that there is a weak positive relationship between ESCS scores and Math scores.

The marginal histograms for both variables also enables readers to additionally infer the distribution of these variables. For example, Math scores resemble a normal distribution, while ESCS scores resemble a left-skewed distribution.

## 3.5 Distribution of students’ performance in Math, Science and Reading by gender across schools

The author had intended to analyse whether there are differences in performances in Math, Reading and Science between genders at a more granular level - within schools.

The author had used the [`pisa.mean.pv`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/intsvy/versions/2.8/topics/pisa.mean.pv) function from [`intsvy`](https://daniel-caro.com/r-intsvy)`package` to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” for each school and by gender.

The below code was used to generate the composite PV values.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

A plot to display the distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores across schools by gender, was generated using the code below.

## The Original Plot

![](images/clipboard-2922052911.png)

The author had created a series of 2 error bars for each school ID across the 3 subjects to represent the subject scores for each gender for all schools (164 schools).

## The code

```{r}
#| eval: false

p8<- ggplot(pvmathgender, aes(x = as.factor(CNTSCHID), y = Mean,fill=ST004D01T))+

| **Clarity**         | 1.  Although the original plot enables me to visualize the differences in scores across schools, I am unclear as to which score this is showing. Is it showing me the range of gender scores by school ID?                                                                      | 1.  Previous visualization had already analysed the differences per school. To further make it more granular by introducing gender, does not seem to add further value in terms of insights.                           |

| **Aesthetics**      | 1.  The use of a vertically long plot to compare the scores across schools makes it visually challenging and difficult to spot differences between schools, and identify any clusters.                                                                                          | 1.  To revise the design of a vertically long format and re-make it to a horizontally compact visualization, by using ridge line plots to show the differences in performance only between the best and worst schools. |
|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2.  To minimize axis labels, we will only identify and plot the top & bottom 5 schools instead.                                                                                                                        |
|                     | 2.  Since there are 164 schools, the use of a vertically long format makes it difficult to read the Y-axis labels. There are too many schools to make identification off the Y-axis easy. This is further compounded with the additional splitting of genders for every school. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Conclusion

The data subset can only be used to visualize the mean scores of the two genders for every school.

The original graph is not of a suitable design to help readers easily and quickly understand the disparity in performances between schools. By adding a further split into genders per school further complicates this visually.

I will use a new compact visualization to enable the reader to quickly identify the disparity in school performance. Instead of analyzing all schools, we can narrow our focus just to the "best" and "worst" schools.

### 3.5.2 Sketch of Proposed Design

Rough sketch of proposed design is shown below.

![](images/clipboard-2581295591.png)

### 3.5.3 Remake

The author had previously extracted the mean scores per school across the 3 subjects. I will use the same sub sets to extract the top and bottom 5 School IDs for each subject.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Identify the top and bottom 5 schools
top_bottom_math <- pvmathsch %>%
  arrange(Mean) %>%
  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %>%
  pull(CNTSCHID)

top_bottom_read <- pvreadsch %>%
  arrange(Mean) %>%
  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %>%
  pull(CNTSCHID)

top_bottom_scie <- pvsciesch %>%
  arrange(Mean) %>%
  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %>%
  pull(CNTSCHID)

```

Next I will filter the data set and obtain PV1 student scores from the top and bottom 5 schools only.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Filter the original dataset to include only the selected schools

top_bottom_mathsch <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_math)

top_bottom_readsch <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_read)

top_bottom_sciesch <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_scie)


top_bottom_mathsch <- top_bottom_mathsch %>%
  mutate(CNTSCHID = factor(CNTSCHID, levels = top_bottom_math))
```

Lastly, I will use the code below to create Ridgeline plots for the top and bottom 5 schools.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

math_5 <- ggplot(top_bottom_mathsch, aes(x = PV1MATH, y = factor(CNTSCHID), fill = after_stat(x))) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
    calc_ecdf = TRUE, 
    quantiles = 4,
    quantile_lines = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    name = "Math Scores",
    colors = c("red", "green"),
    limits = c(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)),
    breaks = seq(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 5)
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,1000)) +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 15)  
  )  +
  labs(y = "School ID", x = NULL, title = "Math Scores for the Top and Bottom 5 Schools") +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)  
  )


math_5

      
```

## Revised plot

By narrowing our focus to compare only the top and bottom 5 schools, we are able to clearly infer the actual difference between the "best" and "worst" schools.

The new revised plot is now more visually compact, and allows readers to quickly examine the difference in performance between the top and bottom 5 schools.
:::

Besides this, we can also examine the differences in performance between Male and Female students in these top and bottom 5 schools, using the code below.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10


# Convert ST004D01T to a factor with more meaningful level names
top_bottom_mathsch$ST004D01T <- factor(top_bottom_mathsch$ST004D01T, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Girls", "Boys"))

# Plot
math_gender_ridges <- ggplot(top_bottom_mathsch, 
                             aes(x = PV1MATH, 
                                 y = interaction(CNTSCHID, ST004D01T),  # Create interaction between school ID and gender
                                 fill = after_stat(x))) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
    calc_ecdf = TRUE, 
    quantiles = 4,
    quantile_lines = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    name = "Math Scores",
    colors = c("red", "green"),
    limits = c(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)),
    breaks = seq(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 5)
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +
  theme_ridges() +
  labs(y = "School ID and Gender", x = "Math Scores", title = "Math Scores for the Top and Bottom 5 Schools by Gender") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)  
  )

math_gender_ridges

## Note

School IDs 70200001, 70200139 and 70200110 does not have any data on Female students and are likely a single-gender school.

# 4. Learning Points

Take-home exercise 2 serves as an extension for take-home exercise 1 and has provided me with an opportunity to reflect on what I have done for take-home exercise 1.

Below are my key takeaways for this assignment:

1.  **Underlying data is crucial**

It is important to understand the underlying data or data set used for the visualization, in order to better understand the design choices behind the visualizations.

For example, in this case, the author had decided to extract composite PV scores instead of utilizing PV1 scores or the average of the PV scores. This decision had limited the author's ability to create more infomative visualizations due to the smaller data set.

2.  **Less is more**

As long as the visualization is clear, and enables the reader to obtain information clearly and quickly, it is a good data visualization.

Rather than striving to pack as much information within a composite plot, it is important to understand how much time and "bandwidth" readers actually have.

For example, combining multiple complex plots at the same time may confuse readers instead of enlightening them.

Static visualizations come with their own limitations. Understanding these limits are important to design good visuals which are easily understood by readers.

Labels, annotations and legends serve to inform, but also increases duplicity. Instead of worrying whether there are enough labels to explain and guide readers, it is better to focus on how easy the reader can obtain that information.

3.  **What is the information you want to communicate?**

It is important to understand the purpose, intent and effect of the visualization. If we are confused about what we want to communicate, readers will feel the same way as well.

4.  **Learning from Peers**
