<section id="problem-statement" class="level1">
<h1>1. Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Consumers are surrounded by Internet of Things (IoT) devices that constantly collect and generate valuable data. According to Statista, there were approximately 15.4 billion connected devices worldwide, a figure that is expected to reach 29 billion by 2030. Yet, the financial services sector hasn’t fully capitalized on this wealth of information.</p>
<p>At the same time, the demand for sustainable choices is on the rise. Specifically, in Singapore, a study by Accenture found that 75% of consumers want to behave more sustainably but lack the avenues and options to do so (WWF-Singapore and Accenture, 2021). They are eager to understand how their everyday actions and purchasing actions could impact and align with Singapore’s national sustainability ambitions. A UOB study further validates this trend. The study revealed that 88% of survey respondents believe that banks and financial institutions should offer more sustainable investing solutions while 91% of the respondents would like to be rewarded for supporting eco-friendly and sustainable businesses. These studies show the high demand for insights into the environmental consequences of financial actions and rewards for sustainable behaviours.</p>
<p>Moreover, the adoption of digital financial applications is growing rapidly in Singapore. A report indicated that the usage of digital payments in Singapore is forecasted to continuously grow from 2018 to 2027, highlighting the rising reliance on such digital financial instruments (Statista , 2023). Together with the user count, the transaction value of digital payments in Singapore is expected to increase, signalling the notion of deeper integration of digital payment means in everyday transactions.</p>
<p>Despite these trends, financial platforms have yet to fully integrate IoT data across a range of IoT eco-systems to sense-make and deliver more holistic insights. This oversight not only hampers the delivery of optimal financial decisions and user experience but also overlooks an opportunity to incentivize sustainable behaviours that have the potential to help corporations and nations meet their sustainability goals at a macro level. The prevailing gap between the IoT ecosystem and financial platforms requires customers to navigate multiple separate platforms, each independent to their own IoT ecosystems.</p>
<p>In an age where many of us juggle a mix of smart gadgets and financial apps, it is challenging to see the bigger picture. How does our latest online purchase affect the environment? Or which financial choices can make a green impact? As we are left connecting the dots, financial institutions are overlooking a golden chance. By bridging these gaps, they could not only empower users towards sustainable choices but also unveil revenue generating avenues by catering to this rising wave of eco-aware consumers.</p>
</section>
<section id="current-system" class="level1">
<h1>2. Current System</h1>
<p>To understand the problem better, existing services provided by Banks, Payment Service Providers and Startups which are related to sustainability tracking are shown in Figure 1 below. The following section details how these groups are contributing to the realm of sustainable finance.</p>

<section id="banks-and-sustainability-tracking" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="banks-and-sustainability-tracking">2.1 Banks and Sustainability Tracking</h2>
<p>Banks and financial institutions are offering their customers insights on their carbon impact, by classifying their payment transactions and calculating an equivalent carbon footprint measure. For example, the Live Better initiative was launched by DBS in 2021 as part of its digital sustainability initiative.</p>
<p>Within the Live Better application, the Track Better carbon calculator (Fig 2) classifies customer debit and credit card transactions into five main categories namely, food, travel, transport, shopping and energy and utilities.&nbsp; Carbon footprint measures are then calculated by multiplying the dollar value of transactions with an internally developed Economic Emissions Factor (EF) to derive an estimated carbon footprint measure (Fig 3) (DBS, 2023).</p>

<section id="identified-market-gaps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identified-market-gaps">2.4 Identified Market Gaps</h2>
<p>According to a consumer sustainability survey by DBS in 2021, 73% of Singaporeans expressed their readiness to adopt a green lifestyle in a fuss-free and intuitive manner, but many have yet to discover the right channels to do so. Furthermore, few were taking meaningful actions to live sustainably as they did not have an easy and effective way to track their carbon footprint across diverse platforms.&nbsp; Although current financial platforms and sustainability initiatives have made commendable strides in providing consumers with insights into their environmental footprint, several gaps remain:</p>
<p><u>Siloed and Fragmented Ecosystems</u>: Current platforms, primarily rely on their proprietary data streams, focusing mainly on transactions made using their cards. This siloed approach misses out on a broader spectrum of financial activities, rendering a limited and sometimes skewed representation of a user’s carbon footprint. For example, the transactions made by direct bank transfers, mobile wallets, and cash, remain uncaptured, leading to incomplete insights into users’ behaviours and subsequently affecting the user experience due to these unaccounted financial activities.</p>
<p><u>Absence of Real-time Data Integration</u>: Current platforms lack integration with IoT devices, missing out on the potential to gather real-time data on various activities which could have environmental implications. Consider vehicles fitted with smart sensors. Retrofitting such devices not only provides immediate feedback on driving efficiency but can also influence fuel consumption, and subsequently, carbon emissions. Integrating such data streams across a <strong>unified platform</strong> can allow for more timely and actionable feedback for users. By receiving real-time emission data from daily activities such as driving, users can make spontaneous decisions to reduce their carbon footprint while at the same time receive financial insights on potential fuel savings based on credit card financial records (E.g., Fuel expenditure at Shell integrated with onboard Car data on fuel uptake).</p>
<p><u>Incentives for Genuine Carbon Reduction</u>: The current system offers consumers a way to balance out their emissions through carbon offsets. However, this approach may inadvertently promote a superficial approach to sustainability. By allowing individuals to “neutralize” specific activities, these platforms might overshadow the broader picture of our environmental impact. Instead, clear <strong>data-driven incentives</strong> should be offered to encourage consumers to proactively reduce their actual carbon footprint, rather than simply compensating for it. True environmental responsibility extends beyond offsets and seeks a deeper change in consumption habits.</p>
<p><u>Behavioural Insights</u>: The existing financial system enables consumers to track their purchasing patterns but <strong>lacks fidelity in tracking behavioural patterns</strong>. Focusing on just payment transactions can lead to overlooking the broader behavioural patterns of consumers. For instance, even if a user spends money on sustainable products, their overall lifestyle might still be environmentally taxing. This could involve scenarios such as consuming organic coffee but regularly using single-use plastics, or buying eco-friendly clothes but wasting water, which are contradictions that the current systems might not capture comprehensively.</p>

<h1>4. Technologies</h1>
<p>In this section, we will elaborate on four technologies which serve as enablers for Eco-Link.</p>
<section id="iot-integration-and-financial-data-synthesis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iot-integration-and-financial-data-synthesis">4.1 IoT Integration and Financial Data Synthesis</h2>
<p>In today’s connected environment, consumers interact with numerous IoT devices that produce a vast amount of data. Much of this data remains untapped within the financial services sector. With the help of IoT Connectivity Platforms such as AWS IoT Core, we will be able to connect IoT data with financial platforms (Hasan, 2022)</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">

</div>
<p>Figure 9 above represents an AWS-based architecture that showcases how IoT connectivity platforms, can integrate IoT data seamlessly with financial platforms.</p>
<section id="integration-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integration-process">Integration Process</h3>
<p><strong>1. IoT Device Connection:</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of this system lies the AWS IoT Core, which establishes a secure connection between various IoT devices and the cloud. Imagine a spectrum of financial devices, ranging from point-of-sale terminals, ATMs, to even personal wearable tech, requiring real time transmission of financial data . AWS IoT Core makes this interconnectivity possible.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Processing and Storage:</strong></p>
<p>Once data from these devices reaches the cloud, serverless compute service <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> can be used to process this information instantly. Every time a user makes a transaction, Lambda can trigger financial analytics or store transactional data.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> serves as the database for storing transactional data, user profiles, and other essential financial datasets. <strong>DynamoDB</strong> offers quick and reliable data retrieval, ensuring that financial platforms have immediate access to required information.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analytics and Insights:</strong></p>
<p>After processing, the raw IoT data needs to be transformed into meaningful insights. <strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it, making it ready for analytics and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon QuickSight</strong> integrates with the processed data to offer visualization tools. Financial analysts can use it to observe market trends, customer spending patterns, and other valuable insights, all derived from the incoming IoT data.</p>
<p><strong>4. Security:</strong></p>
<p>Security is paramount, particularly in the handling of financial data. <strong>AWS IoT Device Defender</strong> monitors and audits IoT configurations to ensure best practices are followed. Simultaneously, <strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> manages user authentication, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to the financial platforms.</p>
<p><strong>5. Data Delivery and User Experience:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon SNS</strong> (Simple Notification Service) can be incorporated to provide real-time alerts. For financial platforms, this could mean instant notifications about market changes, transaction confirmations, or trigger of potential fraud warnings.</p>
<p>Financial platforms often need APIs for third-party integrations. <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> creates, publishes, and secures these APIs, allowing mobile banking apps or trading platforms to securely access the data they need.</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>AWS Amplify</strong>, combined with <strong>Amazon S3</strong> and <strong>CloudFront</strong>, ensures that web applications related to financial platforms are delivered with low latency, guaranteeing a smooth user experience. Additionally, tools like Tableau and SAS Viya can help process this data, providing valuable insights for decision-making (Tableau, 2023). To store this data securely, solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and databases like PostgreSQL and InfluxDB are used.</p>
<p>Through these technology enablers behind IoT devices, we can improve user experience and pave the way for new applications, such as IoT payments. The combination of these technologies ensures that consumers have easy access to financial decisions and sustainability insights (Cointelegraph, 2021).</p>

<section id="ai-driven-finance-and-secure-transaction-ecosystem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-driven-finance-and-secure-transaction-ecosystem">4.2 AI-driven Finance and Secure Transaction Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Today’s consumers use smart devices for a multitude of tasks, and financial decisions are no exception. Given this, there is a clear need for precise AI-driven recommendations to assist in financial planning and actions. By utilizing frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, we aim to create a straightforward system that offers users actionable financial insights based on their behaviours and preferences (Software, 2023).</p>
<p>This AI-centric approach to finance is supported by the trust and security offered by blockchain technology. Platforms like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain provide a secure backdrop for transactions. To streamline these transactions, Eco-Link is integrated with popular payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, and IoT-specific payment systems from Mastercard and Visa. Enhancing this security are protective measures from solutions like Norton IoT Security and TrendMicro.</p>
<p>Below outlines the integration of the IoT payment process:</p>
<p><strong>1. Registration &amp; Association:</strong> First, users must register their IoT device on the platform. This connects the device to a specific service provider’s contract, a step that might require setting up specific APIs or other protocols.</p>
<p><strong>2. Real-time Data Transmission:</strong> As the IoT device functions, it sends real-time data to the platform. This helps determine if the conditions of any contract are met.</p>
<p><strong>3. Validation &amp; Checking:</strong> The platform checks this data against the contract terms to see if conditions have been fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>4. Payment Initiation:</strong> If the data matches contract terms, the platform triggers the payment process, collaborating with the user’s bank or financial institution.</p>
<p><strong>5. Service Provider Notification:</strong> After the payment starts, the platform notifies the service provider with details of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>6. Service Delivery or Continuation</strong>: Depending on the notification, the service provider then delivers the service or product or continues a subscription.</p>
<p>Now consider a scenario where an IoT-equipped car monitors its fuel levels and consumption rates. When the fuel reaches a critically low level, or if the AI identifies an upcoming long journey based on the user’s calendar or habitual routes, it uses data from Google Maps to inform the user of the nearest petrol kiosk. Upon arrival at the station, the vehicle communicates with the pump, and after refuelling, a payment is automatically initiated. The platform’s AI, understanding the driver’s typical routes and consumption patterns, ensures that the driver is always aware of nearby fuelling options, optimizing both convenience and fuel efficiency.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 12: Climatiq application architecture (Wenzel, 2023)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Figure 12 above showcases a holistic infrastructure of Climatiq, demonstrating an integration of several components. This interplay of technologies underscores the potential for comprehensive data gathering, analysis, and insight generation. As illustrated, Climatiq seamlessly interacts with third-party systems, including ERP and data warehouses. This allows for the automated gathering of vast data necessary for accurate carbon emissions calculations, making it apt for Eco-Link to obtain holistic insights.</p>
<p>Central to Climatiq’s model is its REST API, which facilitates smooth communication between different components (Climatiq, 2023). The REST API could empower Eco-Link by allowing different eco-conscious modules or services to interact efficiently, sharing data and insights in real-time. To establish trust and security, Climatiq employs auth0 for user and admin authentication. A secure login mechanism not only ensures data integrity but also instills confidence in users. By adopting a similar authentication approach, Eco-Link can ensure its user data remains uncompromised.</p>
<p>By using Vercel and NEXT.Js, Climatiq maintains visually appealing front-end and robust functionalities.&nbsp; For Eco-Link, this means users can have interactive dashboards, real-time configurations, and insights presented in an easily digestible manner, fostering informed eco-decisions. Finally, to facilitate real-time estimations and analytics, Fastly’s Compute@Edge offers caching and real-time estimations, which, when combined with fauna’s Geo Distributed DB Cluster, ensures data is retrieved from the nearest available source. This minimizes latency, provides faster response times, and, importantly, reduces emissions from distant server retrievals. Such capabilities would be invaluable to Eco-Link, allowing it to provide users with instantaneous insights and recommendations based on real-time data.</p>
</section>
<section id="tokenization-and-digitizing-credentials" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenization-and-digitizing-credentials">4.4 Tokenization and Digitizing Credentials</h2>
<p>Payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard play a pivotal role in advancing IoT payments. They have been instrumental in building the framework to promote token availability and interoperability across IoT devices. This involves developing and maintaining the necessary technology for IoT commerce, especially in tokenization and digitizing credentials (Visa, 2023).</p>
<p>These networks also offer scalable frameworks for issuers and IoT device manufacturers, with initiatives like Visa’s Visa Token Service(VTS). They collaborate with a variety of stakeholders, from car manufacturers to wearables brands, extending the payment value chain.</p>
<p>The below diagram illustrates Visa’s token provisioning and activation occurs. This is a One-Time action per payment credential.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/clipboard-2139999320.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Figure 13: Token provisioning and activation process (Visa, 2017)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The token provisioning and activation process, as depicted in the diagram (Figure 13), is an integral part of Visa’s approach to fortifying IoT payments. This procedure starts when a cardholder loads their Visa account details onto a connected device. Once loaded, the device sends a request to provision the account to a token requestor, acting as an intermediary (Eco-Link). The token requestor, in turn, fetches the necessary credentials from the Visa Token Service. Crucially, instead of transmitting the actual Payment Account Number (PAN), the system replaces it with a digital token—a surrogate value. This ensures the actual payment details remain shielded.</p>
<p>The Visa Risk Manager evaluates the provisioning request, making decisions based on established approval rules set by the Visa account issuer. Once the token is greenlit, it is then provisioned to the device and activated for payments. The strength of this system lies in its ability to protect sensitive payment information. Even if there’s an unauthorized breach, the exposed token is rendered valueless to cybercriminals, as it does not carry the actual card details.</p>
<p>In essence, Visa’s tokenization system is a multi-step, highly secure approach that leverages advanced technology to ensure both convenience and safety in the expanding realm of IoT payments.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>3. Vulnerability to DDoS Attacks:</strong></p>
<p>Several IoT devices lack sufficient protection against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Pre-set factory settings amplify the risk of unauthorized remote access. Additionally, the low user interaction with IoT devices can lead to under-detection of such breaches.</p>
<p>Given the above challenges, the following security considerations become essential for IoT payments:</p>
<p>· <strong>Authenticated Payments:</strong></p>
<p>Many IoT applications are designed for payments to occur autonomously, without human intervention. Such operations underscore the importance of robust authentication mechanisms. When a car autonomously pays for parking or a refrigerator procures groceries, the underlying technology should ensure the transactions are authentic and authorized.</p>
<p>· <strong>Identifying Devices in Transactions:</strong></p>
<p>Payments involve not just the transfer between accounts but also between entities, with one party often being an IoT device. This necessitates a system where devices maintain distinct and verifiable identities to secure the data they transfer.</p>
<p>· <strong>Managing Payment Discrepancies:</strong></p>
<p>In instances of transactional errors or disputes, it is vital to determine liability. Strong device authentication combined with user authorization measures are key in ensuring the legitimacy and accountability of transactions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="financial-institutions-and-service-providers-retail-partners">9.2 Financial Institutions and Service Providers / Retail Partners</h2>
<p><strong>Financial Institutions:</strong></p>

<section id="future-outlook" class="level1">
<h1>10. Future Outlook</h1>
<p>Global trends emphasize eco-conscious living, ensuring that an integrated solution like Eco-Link will garner immense popularity. With that, Eco-Link presents limitless future possibilities and there are various ways to expand on this solution. These are some of the possible areas that our solution, Eco-Link can pivot to enhance the user experiences and eventually meet the ever-increasing payment needs of the consumers.</p>
<p><u>Enrichment of User Experience</u></p>
<p>The platform can scale up to include more enriching content to serve our customers. Analytical insights can be applied to the users’ data to present tailored blogs and tutorials. For example, if Eco-Link picks up on user’s constant payments to ride hailing services, the platform can bring up articles and blogs related to carbon emission from private transportation and other environmental implications which can then urge and remind users to take up a more eco-conscious commute. In addition, the platform can push out facts and posts on the environmental initiatives happening in Singapore. Users are then well-informed deepening their intents for sustainable finance.</p>
<p><u>Peer to Peer Interactive Elements</u></p>
<p>Eco-Link can be gamified by tabulating the energy scores and presenting them in a publicly visible score dashboard. This Peer-to-Peer feature can allow the platform users to share their sustainability scores to the rest of the application users promoting the ongoing environmental efforts and healthy competition amidst the users. The top performers could be incentivised further to continue with their sustainable payment efforts.</p>
<p><u>Integration of other IoT Devices</u></p>
<p>In the long run, partnerships with other IoT providers can be forged. Through this, consumers can elect to connect their IoT devices to our platform and utilize the platform to make payments and track their finances sustainably (PYMNTS, 2022).</p>

<figcaption>Figure 17: Conceptual representation of integrating multiple IoT Ecosystems by DALL.E 2</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Eco-Link could maintain an open API to share data across other IoT ecosystems such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa. By integrating these devices, users can get notifications on the energy consumption within their homes, and we could even provide more services such as recurring payment plans. For instance, if a person links their smart home devices to Eco-Link’s system, they can track their energy consumption together with their other finances and associated energy consumptions. This way they can get a fuller picture of their energy trends and along the pipeline, payment arrangements can be made via Eco-Link. Users can use the Eco-Link’s digital wallet to trigger monthly payments to utility companies for their household energy consumption. Eco-Link could expand by forming these future partnerships with other IoT vendors (e.g.&nbsp;smart appliances/ gadgets) which is a win-win situation for both consumers and partners. Eco-Link can serve as the intermediary between these two groups where vendors can promote their services (e.g.&nbsp;easy statement retrievals, auto payments through Eco-Link). Meanwhile, users can continue to track their finance and their carbon emissions sustainably for the various services used by them.</p>
<p><strong>As such, Eco-Link can become an indispensable tool in modern, sustainable living.</strong></p>
