    "text": "Having spent many years lost in a traditional finance career, I’ve finally found the courage to start learning about Data Science.\nNow, I’m on my second wind, and hope to become someone more than just to “increase shareholder value”.\n\nNever settle, and always strive to be a better version of yourself every day. It’s never to late to start something or learn something new. Your ability is not determined by your age.\n\n“Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion” - Michael Jordan.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
