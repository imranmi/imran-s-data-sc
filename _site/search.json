    "text": "Setting the Scene\nOECD education director Andreas Schleicher shared in a BBC article that “Singapore managed to achieve excellence without wide differences between children from wealthy and disadvantaged families.” (2016) Furthermore, several of Singapore’s ministers for Education also started an “every school a good school” slogan. The general public, however, believes that there are still disparities that exist, especially between “elite” and neighborhood schools, between students from families with higher socioeconomic status and those with relatively lower socioeconomic status and immigration and non-immigration families.\n\n\nThe Task\nThe 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data was released on December 5, 2022. PISA’s global education survey runs every three years to assess education systems worldwide through the testing 15 year old students in the subjects of mathematics, reading, and science.\nIn this take-home exercise, we will use appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods and ggplot2 functions to reveal:\n\nthe distribution of Singapore students’ performance in mathematics, reading, and science, and\nthe relationship between these performances with schools, gender and socioeconomic status of the students.\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nLoading R packages\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace)\n\nImporting the Data\n\nstu_qqq_SG &lt;- read_rds(\"data/stu_qqq_SG.rds\")\n\nLoading the instvy package.\n\n# install.packages(\"intsvy\",repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n\nlibrary(\"intsvy\")\n\nExtracting the overall student mean score values for each subject\n\nMath_mean_SG &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"MATH\"), by=\"CNT\", data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\nRead_mean_SG &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"READ\"), by=\"CNT\", data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\nSCIE_mean_SG &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"SCIE\"), by=\"CNT\", data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\n\n\n1) Distribution of scores in the student cohort\nWe will use the code below to plot histograms to show the distribution of scores across the 3 subjects.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create the histogram plot with an annotated mean line using Math_mean_SG\nplt1 &lt;- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1MATH)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, color = \"white\", fill='lightblue') +\n  labs(x = \"Math Scores\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = Math_mean_SG$Mean,\n             col = 'black',\n             size = 0.5,\n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = Math_mean_SG$Mean, y = 100, label = paste(\"Mean =\", round(Math_mean_SG$Mean, 2))),\n            color = \"black\", hjust = -0.1, vjust = 1.0) +  # Adjust label position\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Create the histogram plot with an annotated mean line using Read_mean_SG\nplt2 &lt;- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1READ)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, color = \"white\", fill='lightgreen') +\n  labs(x = \"Reading Scores\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = Read_mean_SG$Mean,\n             col = 'black',\n             size = 0.5,\n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = Read_mean_SG$Mean, y = 100, label = paste(\"Mean =\", round(Read_mean_SG$Mean, 2))),\n            color = \"black\", hjust = -0.1, vjust = 1.0) +  # Adjust label position\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n# Create the histogram plot with an annotated mean line using Science_mean_SG\nplt3 &lt;- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, color = \"white\", fill='lightpink') +\n  labs(x = \"Science Scores\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = SCIE_mean_SG$Mean,\n             col = 'black',\n             size = 0.5,\n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = SCIE_mean_SG$Mean, y = 100, label = paste(\"Mean =\", round(SCIE_mean_SG$Mean, 2))),\n            color = \"black\", hjust = -0.1, vjust = 1.0) +  # Adjust label position\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Create a single plot with density plots for Math, Reading, and Science scores\nplt4 &lt;- ggplot(stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = \"Math\")) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1READ, fill = \"Reading\"), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = PV1SCIE, fill = \"Science\"), alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Subject Scores\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Math\" = \"lightblue\", \"Reading\" = \"lightgreen\", \"Science\" = \"lightpink\")) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +  # Remove the legend\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nWe use the code below to create a composite plot.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\npatch1 &lt;- (plt1+plt2) / (plt3+plt4)  + \n              plot_annotation(\n                title = \"Distribution of student performance in Math, Reading and Science\")\n\npatch1 & theme( axis.text.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 1\n\n\n\nThe distribution of scores seem to resemble a normal distribution across all 3 subjects. Singaporean students seem to have a higher mean score In Mathematics relative to Reading and Science.\nFurther statistical tests like the Anderson-Darling or Shapiro-Wilk tests will need to be conducted to confirm the normality in distribution.\n\n\n\n\n2) Relationship between Scores and School ID\nThe pisa.mean.pv() function from the instvy package enables us to calculate the mean scores from the 10 Plausible Values and enables us to further group by the School ID (CNTSCHID).\nIn the code below, we will create separate tables for the mean scores for each subject by different School Ids.\n\nSchoolid_math &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"MATH\"), by = \"CNTSCHID\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\nSchoolid_read &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"READ\"), by = \"CNTSCHID\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\nSchoolid_scie &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"SCIE\"), by = \"CNTSCHID\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\nNext, we use the below code to plot bubble plots to examine the number of students and their mean scores for each school. We will also use the plotly package for added interactivity.\n\nMean Math scores across SchoolsMean Reading scores across SchoolsMean Science scores across Schools\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nbest_sch_math &lt;- Schoolid_math %&gt;% filter(Mean == max(Mean))\nworst_sch_math &lt;- Schoolid_math %&gt;% filter(Mean == min(Mean))\n\n\np_1 &lt;- ggplot(Schoolid_math, aes(x = CNTSCHID, y = Mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Freq, color = Freq), alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"skyblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Math Scores per School\",\n    y = \"Mean Math Scores\", \n    size = \"Number of Students\", \n    color = \"Number of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # Remove minor grid lines\n\n# Annotate the best and worst mean scores\np_1 &lt;- p_1 + \n  geom_text(data = best_sch_math, aes(label = \"Best\", y = Mean + 12), vjust = 1, hjust=-1) +\n  geom_text(data = worst_sch_math, aes(label = \"Worst\", y = Mean - 12), vjust = 1)\n\n\n# Convert to an interactive plot\nggplotly(p_1, tooltip = c(\"x\", \"y\", \"size\", \"color\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nbest_sch_read &lt;- Schoolid_read %&gt;% filter(Mean == max(Mean))\nworst_sch_read &lt;- Schoolid_read %&gt;% filter(Mean == min(Mean))\n\np_2 &lt;- ggplot(Schoolid_read, aes(x = CNTSCHID, y = Mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Freq, color = Freq), alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"yellow\", high = \"darkorchid\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Reading Scores per School\",\n    y = \"Mean Reading Scores\", \n    size = \"Number of Students\", \n    color = \"Number of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # Remove minor grid lines\n\n# Annotate the best and worst mean scores\np_2 &lt;- p_2 + \n  geom_text(data = best_sch_read, aes(label = \"Best\", y = Mean + 12), vjust = 1, hjust=-1) +\n  geom_text(data = worst_sch_read, aes(label = \"Worst\", y = Mean - 12), vjust = 1)\n\n# Convert to an interactive plot\nggplotly(p_2, tooltip = c(\"x\", \"y\", \"size\", \"color\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nbest_sch_scie &lt;- Schoolid_scie %&gt;% filter(Mean == max(Mean))\nworst_sch_scie &lt;- Schoolid_scie %&gt;% filter(Mean == min(Mean))\n\n\np_3 &lt;- ggplot(Schoolid_scie, aes(x = CNTSCHID, y = Mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Freq, color = Freq), alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"lightpink\", high = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Science Scores per School\",\n    y = \"Mean Science Scores\", \n    size = \"Number of Students\", \n    color = \"Number of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # Remove minor grid lines\n\n# Annotate the best and worst mean scores\np_3 &lt;- p_3 + \n  geom_text(data = best_sch_scie, aes(label = \"Best\", y = Mean + 12), vjust = 1, hjust=-1) +\n  geom_text(data = worst_sch_scie, aes(label = \"Worst\", y = Mean - 12), vjust = 1)\n\n# Convert to an interactive plot\nggplotly(p_3, tooltip = c(\"x\", \"y\", \"size\", \"color\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 2\n\n\n\nThe ability to extract and assign Mean scores to individual schools enables us to further explore and examine the disparity in performance between schools. For example, looking at the two extremes of score results, we note that Schools (70200001 & 70200003) out perform other schools in Math and Science. On the other hand, Schools (7020115 & 70200149) under perform other schools in Math and Science.\nThis seems to indicate that there are still marked differences between the ‘’best” schools and the’‘worst’’ schools. Additional analysis could be done to identify the differences between these two sets of schools in terms of resources, teaching quality, and students attitudes or motivation etc, in order to fully understand the reason behind the difference in the scores.\n\n\n\n\n3) Relationship Between Gender and Scores\nFirst we create a subset of Gender and PV1 scores using the below code. We also convert the levels from 1 and 2, to Female and Male respectively.\n\n# Create a subset of the data with gender and PV1 score columns\nsubset_gender_PV1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  select(ST004D01T, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)\n\n# Convert the \"ST004D01T\" column to a factor \nsubset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T &lt;- factor(subset_gender_PV1$ST004D01T, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\"))\n\nNext we plot the ridgeline plots with quantile lines.\n\n\nShow the code\nrp1 &lt;- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH, \n           y = ST004D01T, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Math Scores\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nrp2 &lt;- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1,\n       aes(x = PV1READ, \n           y = ST004D01T, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Reading Scores\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nrp3 &lt;- ggplot(subset_gender_PV1,\n       aes(x = PV1SCIE, \n           y = ST004D01T, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Science Scores\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nWe use the code below to create a composite plot via patchwork\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\npatch6 &lt;- rp1 / rp2 / rp3 + \n              plot_annotation(\n                title = \"Male students seem to perform better in Math and Science\")\n\npatch6 & theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 3\n\n\n\nMales students seem to outperform Female students in both Maths and Science. Female students seem to outperform Male students in Reading.\n\n\n\n\n4) Relationship between Scores and Socioeconomic status of students\nWe will create a new subset with ESCS and the PV1 scores for this visualization.\n\nsubset_ESCS_PV1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  select(ESCS, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)\n\n#omiting NA values\nsubset_ESCS_PV1 &lt;- na.omit(subset_ESCS_PV1)\n\nUsing our new table subset_ESCS_PV1, we will create scatter plots for ESCS versus each PV1 score for each subject using the code below.\n\n\nShow the code\nc_coeff_ESCS_Math &lt;- cor(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS, subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1MATH)\n\nC_plt1 &lt;- ggplot(subset_ESCS_PV1, aes(x = ESCS, y = PV1MATH)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(\n    x = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS),  \n    y = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1MATH),  \n    label = paste(\"Corr Coeff:\", round(c_coeff_ESCS_Math, 2)),\n    hjust = 1,  # Adjust horizontal justification\n    vjust = 1   # Adjust vertical justification\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"Socio-Economic Status (ESCS)\",\n    y = \"Math Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nc_coeff_ESCS_Read &lt;- cor(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS, subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1READ)\n\nC_plt2 &lt;- ggplot(subset_ESCS_PV1, aes(x = ESCS, y = PV1READ)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightgreen\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(\n    x = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS),  \n    y = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1READ),  \n    label = paste(\"Corr Coeff:\", round(c_coeff_ESCS_Read, 2)),\n    hjust = 1,  # Adjust horizontal justification\n    vjust = 1   # Adjust vertical justification\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"Socio-Economic Status (ESCS)\",\n    y = \"Reading Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nc_coeff_ESCS_Scie &lt;- cor(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS, subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1SCIE)\n\nC_plt3 &lt;- ggplot(subset_ESCS_PV1, aes(x = ESCS, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightpink\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(\n    x = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$ESCS),  \n    y = max(subset_ESCS_PV1$PV1SCIE),  \n    label = paste(\"Corr Coeff:\", round(c_coeff_ESCS_Scie, 2)),\n    hjust = 1,  # Adjust horizontal justification\n    vjust = 1   # Adjust vertical justification\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"Socio-Economic Status (ESCS)\",\n       y = \"Science Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nWe will use patchwork to create a composite plot for our scatter plots.\n\n\nShow the code\npatch4 &lt;- C_plt1 / C_plt2 / C_plt3 + \n              plot_annotation(\n                title = \"Weak positive relationship between Scores and ESCS\")\n\npatch4 & theme( axis.text.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 4\n\n\n\nThere is a weak positive relationship between subject scores and Socioeconomic statuses. The ESCS score is a composite score calculated from three indicators: highest parental occupation status (HISEI), highest education of parents in years (PAREDINT), and home possessions (HOMEPOS).\nFurther analysis could be conducted on the individual components of the ESCS score to check for their individual influence on student performance.\n\n\n\n\n5) Examining the Breakdown of scores per Subject\nWe can further examine the percentage of students per score range for each subject. This might help us examine whether there are specific strengths or weaknesses in the student cohort.\nFirst, we use the pisa.ben.pv() function from the instvy package which calculates student scores from the 10 plausible values and calculates the percentage of students at each proficiency level (Score range) as defined by PISA.\nIn the code below, we will create separate tables for the percentage breakdown of scores for each subject.\n\n\nShow the code\nMath_Breakdown &lt;- pisa.ben.pv(pvlabel= paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"MATH\"), by=\"CNT\", atlevel=TRUE, data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\nRead_Breakdown &lt;- pisa.ben.pv(pvlabel= paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"READ\"), by=\"CNT\", atlevel=TRUE, data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\nScie_Breakdown &lt;- pisa.ben.pv(pvlabel= paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"SCIE\"), by=\"CNT\", atlevel=TRUE, data=stu_qqq_SG)\n\n\nNext, we can combine these tables and plots into one plot to show the percentage of students per Score Range for all subjects.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creating a new combined table\n\nMath_Breakdown$Subject &lt;- 'Math'\nRead_Breakdown$Subject &lt;- 'Reading'\nScie_Breakdown$Subject &lt;- 'Science'\n\nCombined_Breakdown &lt;- bind_rows(Math_Breakdown, Read_Breakdown, Scie_Breakdown)\n\n\nThe code below enables us to plot the breakdown of scores for all subjects.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Order the Benchmarks factor based on the order it appears in the dataset\nCombined_Breakdown &lt;- Combined_Breakdown %&gt;%\n  mutate(Benchmarks = fct_inorder(Benchmarks))\n\n# Now plot using ggplot\nggplot(Combined_Breakdown, aes(x = Benchmarks, y = Percentage, fill = Subject)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +  # Dodge position for the bars\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Percentage)),  # This will format the label to have 1 decimal place and a percentage sign\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),  # Match the position of the text with the dodged bars\n    vjust = -0.25,   \n    size = 2  \n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Math\" = \"lightblue\", \"Reading\" = \"lightgreen\", \"Science\" = \"lightpink\")) +\n  labs(title = \"For lower Score ranges, students seem to do better in Reading\",\n       x = \"Score Range\",\n       y = \"Percentage of Students\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 5\n\n\n\nCombined bar plots can allow us to obtain insights on relative performance. For example, for scores below 544.68, we can see that at lower score ranges, students seem to do better in Reading relative to Math and Science. However, at higher score ranges, students do worse in Reading relative to Math and Science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Intsvy also provides a merge function to merge the student, school, parent, teacher and cognitive databases.\nTo understand more about the packages available and the methodology to analyse the PISA data files, please refer to this link.\nThe analytical commands within intsvy enables users to derive mean statistics, standard deviations, frequency tables, correlation coefficients and regression estimates.\nAdditionally, intsvy deals with the calculation of point estimates and standard errors that take into account the complex PISA sample design with replicate weights, as well as the rotated test forms with plausible values.\nTo understand more about the instvy package, please refer to this link.\n\ninstall.packages(\"intsvy\",repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n\nWe will load the package using library()\n\nlibrary(\"intsvy\")"

On the other hand, Schools (7020115 & 70200149) under perform other schools in all subjects.\n\nThis shows that there are still marked differences between the ‘’best” schools and the’‘worst’’ schools.

From the combined plot, we can see that at lower score ranges, students seem to do better in Reading relative to Math and Science. However, at higher score ranges, students do worse in Reading relative to Math and Science.\n\n3) Violin plots for Gender performance across subjects\nPreviously we had used box plots to visualize the difference in performance between the genders across subjects.

This could be useful for detecting data patterns and clusters.\nViolin plots could also emphasize the concentration of data points and potential outliers, showcasing the entire range of the data including peaks, valleys, and tails that may not be evident from box plots.\n\n4) Relationship between Scores and the times spent on studying or homework before or after school\nThe objective of this visualization is to examine the relationship between student scores and the time spent on studying or on homework (STUDYHMW).\nThe variable “STUDYHMW” measures how many times during a typical school week students studied for school or homework before going to school and/or after leaving school. Values on this index range from 0 (no studying) to 10 (10 or more times of studying per week).\nFirst we check for any missing values in the STUDYHMW column using the code below.\n\n# Check for NAs in the 'STUDYHMW' column\nhas_nas &lt;- any(is.na(stu_qqq_SG$STUDYHMW))\n\nprint(has_nas)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSince there are missing values in the STUDYHMW column, we shall delete the rows with missing values. We will then create a new table with STUDYHMW and the Mean scores of the 10 Plausible Values for this visualization.\nThe pisa.mean.pv() function from the instvy package enables us to calculate the mean scores from the 10 Plausible Values and enables us to further group by the time spent on studying (STUDYHMW).\nIn the code below, we will create separate tables for the mean scores for each subject.\n\n\nShow the code\nhomework_math &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"MATH\"), by = \"STUDYHMW\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\nhomework_read &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"READ\"), by = \"STUDYHMW\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\nhomework_scie &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel = paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"SCIE\"), by = \"STUDYHMW\", data = stu_qqq_SG)\n\n\nWe examine the new tables created.\n\nprint(homework_math)\n\n   STUDYHMW Freq   Mean  s.e.

Is it PV1 or average of the PV values?\nGraph is titled as “Scores across Math, Reading and Science”, however the code indicates that mean scores +/- one standard deviation were generated instead.\nThe data subset used for this plot only has 3 observations and 6 variables. Upon inspecting the data set, it is actually the composite mean score for each subject for the entire student cohort.\n\n\nThe code and subset used is not suitable to plot a Distribution of student scores across subjects. I will extract a new subset with all PV1 scores at the individual student level. This will then be used to plot the distribution of student scores for the different subjects.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThere is already a legend on the right which identifies subjects by colour, thus making the Y axis labels seem redundant.\nThe scale for the X-axis is from 0 to 1000, in increments of 50. Because of the “shortness” of the error bars, the graph appears too elongated. This contributes to “extra” space and additional non-data ink.\nUnable to decipher the actual scores even with the X-axis tick marks.\nSince the subjects are clearly labelled in the Y axis, the label “Subject” can be removed, to minimize non-data ink.\n\n\nTo remove the legend or Y-Axis labels, to reduce non-data ink.\nShorten the X-axis, or extract new data points to populate the correct range of scores.\nTo annotate the mean scores onto the plot, so that we can remove the background grid lines and X-axis tick marks and reduce non-data ink.\nTo remove the label “Subject”, since it does not provide additional information to readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nUpon closer examination of the code used, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.\n\n#geom_errorbar(\n    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD),\n    #width = 0.5,\n    #size=0.8,\n    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)\n\nI would conclude that this plot is actually comparing the mean subject scores across subjects.\n\n\nExamining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.\n\nprint(mergedgeneral)\n\n  Freq   Mean s.e.

Is it showing me the range of student scores by school ID?\nGraph is titled as “Subject Scores by school”, however the code indicates that mean scores +/- one standard deviation were generated instead.\nThe data subset used for this visualization only has 164 observations and 6 variables. Upon inspecting the data set, this subset is basically the composite mean subject scores for each school.\n\n\nThe original subset can still be used, but the code will need to be changed for the revised visualization. This new visualization will retain the original intent to show the different mean scores for each of the 164 schools to visualize the relative performance between schools.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe use of a vertically long plot to compare the scores across schools makes it visually challenging and difficult to spot differences in scores, and identify any clusters.\nSince there are 164 schools, the use of a vertically long format makes it difficult to read the school IDs on the Y-axis. There are too many schools to make identification off the Y-axis easy.\nThe distance between the X-axis, which shows the scores is too far apart from the error bars. I am unable to decipher what are the actual scores or score range for each error bar.\nThe graph is stiched side by side, resulting in the Y-axis being repeated 3 times. The order of the School IDs are all the same, hence this creates additional non-data ink, that makes the graph too “busy”.\n\n\nTo revise the design of a vertically long format and re-make it to a horizontally compact visualization, by using bubble plots.\nTo minimize axis labels, we can drop axis labels for school id, and only identify and directly annotate the top & bottom 5 schools instead.\nTo remove the 2 other repetitive Y-axes to reduce non-data ink.\n\n\n\n\nExamining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.\n\nprint(head(pvmathsch))\n\n  CNTSCHID Freq   Mean  s.e.

I will employ color as a means to differentiate the mean scores.\nI have also added reference lines to show the 10th and 90th percentile scores to help readers easily identify the schools belonging to these two opposite segments.\nLastly, I have also added annotations to help readers to quickly identify the top 5 and bottom 5 schools with the best and worst mean scores.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 schools\ntop_5 &lt;- pvmathsch %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(Mean)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5)\n\nbottom_5 &lt;- pvmathsch %&gt;% \n  arrange(Mean) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n# Base plot with points colored by the mean score\np1 &lt;- ggplot(pvmathsch, aes(x = CNTSCHID, y = Mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Mean), alpha = 0.5, size = 7) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"green\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Math Scores per School\",\n       subtitle = \"5 Schools with the Best & Worst mean scores\",\n       x = \"School ID\",\n       y = \"Mean Math Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank())  # Remove major grid lines\n       \n\n# Annotate the top 5 and bottom 5 schools\np1 &lt;- p1 +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = top_5, \n    aes(label = CNTSCHID, y = Mean), \n    color = \"blue\", \n    size = 3, \n    nudge_y = 12,   # Adjust nudge_y if necessary to move text up or down\n    direction = \"y\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = bottom_5, \n    aes(label = CNTSCHID, y = Mean), \n    color = \"blue\", \n    size = 3, \n    nudge_y = -12,  # Adjust nudge_y if necessary to move text up or down\n    direction = \"y\"\n  )\n\n# Calculate the 10th and 90th percentiles\npercentile10 &lt;- quantile(pvmathsch$Mean, probs = 0.10, na.rm = TRUE)\npercentile90 &lt;- quantile(pvmathsch$Mean, probs = 0.90, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Add horizontal lines for the 10th and 90th percentiles to your plot\np1 &lt;- p1 + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = percentile10, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = percentile90, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = percentile10, label = paste(\"10th Percentile:\", round(percentile10, 2))), \n            hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0, color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = percentile90, label = paste(\"90th Percentile:\", round(percentile90, 2))), \n            hjust = 1.05, vjust = 1, color = \"blue\", size = 3)\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Plot\n\n\n\nThe use of colour can help readers quickly differentiate the scores between schools.\n\nI have annotated school IDs for the top and bottom 5 schools for readers to quickly identify the “best” and “worst” schools.\nI have also added reference lines for the 10th and 90th Percentile. Here we can quickly see that while most of the 164 schools attain the same range of mean scores, there are a number of schools that outperform the rest.\nAnnotating all the 164 school IDs will add too much ink to the plot. Hence, we can consider having another interactive plot (below) for readers to examine the data points in more detail at their descretion.\n\n\nFor interactivity, I have used ggplotly() to convert this to an interactive graph. With the added interactivity, readers can use the tooltip function to get more information on the data points.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Convert to an interactive plot\nggplotly(p1, tooltip = c(\"x\", \"y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome of the previous annotations generated in the static plot may not appear after turning it into an interactive plot. Hence, we can use both static and interactive plots together if needed. For example, static charts to quickly summarize and communicate information to reader, and an interactive plot for readers to drill down in more detail, eg use of zoom, identifying specific data points via tooltip etc."

    "text": "3.4 Distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores by socioeconomic status\nThe author had previously created a new variable, “ESCS_recoded”, which bins the socio-economic (ESCS) score into four quantiles - “Very Low”, “Low”, “Medium” and “High”. The author had used the pisa.mean.pv function from intsvypackage to obtain the Mean and Standard Deviation of PV values from “PV1MATH” to “PV10MATH”, “PV1READ” to “PV10READ” and “PV1SCIE” to “PV10SCIE” and grouped by the ESCS score.\nThe code below was used to generate the composite PV values for Math, Reading and Science.\n\n\nShow the code\npvmathescs &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"MATH\"),c(\"ESCS_recoded\"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name=\"pvmathescs\",folder=data_folder_path)\n\npvreadescs &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"READ\"),c(\"ESCS_recoded\"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name=\"pvreadescs\",folder=data_folder_path)\n\npvscieescs &lt;- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel=paste0(\"PV\",1:10,\"SCIE\"),c(\"ESCS_recoded\"), data=stu_qqq_SG_clean,export=FALSE,name=\"pvscieescs\",folder=data_folder_path)\n\n\nA plot to display the distribution of Math, Reading and Science scores across schools by socioeconomic status was generated using the code below.\n\nThe Original plotThe code\n\n\n\nThe author had created a series of error bars to represent the scores across the 4 categories of the ESCS score (High, Medium, Low, Very Low).\n\n\n\nggplot(pvscieescs, aes(x = ESCS_recoded, y = Mean,fill=ESCS_recoded))+\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5),lwd=0.5,show.legend=FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = mean,\n    geom = \"point\",\n    shape = 10,\n    size = 2,\n    aes(colour=ESCS_recoded),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ESCS_recoded),\n    width = 0.5,\n    size=1,\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Science Scores by Socioeconomic Status\") +\n  ylab(\"Science Score\") +\n  xlab(\"Socioeconomic Status\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000),breaks = seq(0, 1000, by=200))+\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Criteria\nCritique/Feedback\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nClarity\n\nAlthough the original plot enables me to visualize the differences in scores between the ESCS categories, I am unclear as to which score this is showing. Is it showing me the range of PV1 scores or average of PV values?\nGraph is titled as “Subject Scores by Socioeconomic Status”, however the code indicates that mean scores +/- one standard deviation were generated instead.\nThe data subset used for the plots only has 4 observations and 6 variables. Upon inspecting the data set, this is actually just the overall mean scores for each of the newly binned ESCS score category.\n\n\nThe code and subset used is not suitable to plot a range or distribution of scores for each ESCS score category.\nI will extract a new subset with all PV1 scores at the individual student level together with ESCS scores per student. I will then plot the relationship between the two continuous variables (subject scores and ESCS score) via scatter plots.\nA scatter plots will enable readers to quickly infer the relationships between subject scores and socioeconomic statuses.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe Y-axis is already well labelled and identifies the different socioeconomic segments clearly, the use of different colors per segment together with legend is not necessary.\nThe scale for the X-axis is from 0 to 1000, in increments of 50. Because of the “shortness” of the error bars, the graph appears too elongated.\nEven with the background grid lines and X axis tick marks, I am unable to decipher the actual scores clearly.\n\n\nTo remove the legend since the ESCS segments are already differentiated by colour and identifiable through the Y-axis labels.\nShorten the X-axis, or extract new data points to correctly populate the range of scores.\nTo annotate the mean scores onto the plot, so that we can remove the background grid lines and X-axis tick marks and reduce non-data ink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nUpon closer examination of the code below, the author had included an error bar with Mean +/- one standard deviation.\n\n#geom_errorbar(\n    #aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD,color=ESCS_recoded),\n    #width = 0.5,\n    #size=1,\n    #position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)\n\nHence the original plot can only be used to compare the mean subject scores across different ESCS segments.\n\n\nExamining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.\n\nprint(pvscieescs)\n\n  ESCS_recoded Freq   Mean s.e.

For example, why should there be 4 segments of socioeconomic statuses instead of 3, or 6?\nCould the number of socioeconomic segments be applicable for other countries? For example, would a “Low segment” in Singapore be equivalent to a “Low segment” in another country?\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Sketch of Proposed Design\nRough sketch of proposed design is shown below.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Remake\nInstead of binning the ESCS score and transforming it to a categorical type, I will keep the ESCS score as a continuous variable.\nI will use scatter plots to visualize the strength or weaknesses of the relationships between the socioeconomic statuses and subject scores.\nDrawing inspiration from Prof Kam’s Lesson 3 and well as additional useful references, I will proceed to plot Scatter plots with Marginal Histograms.\nIn terms of data, I will use the PV1 scores which at the individual student level.\nFor this visualization, I will use the ggstatplot package. (Patil 2021)\nFor more information on this package and how it can be used to create graphics from statistical tests included in the plots themselves, please refer to this link.\n\nlibrary(ggstatsplot)\n\nCreating new data subset for visualization.\n\n\nShow the code\nsubset_ESCS_PV1 &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  select(ESCS, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ)\n\n#omiting NA values\nsubset_ESCS_PV1 &lt;- na.omit(subset_ESCS_PV1)\n\n\nWe will use the code below from ggstatplot package to generate the plot.\n\n\nShow the code\nggscatterstats(\n  data = subset_ESCS_PV1,                                          \n  x = ESCS,                                                  \n  y = PV1MATH,\n  xlab = \"Socioeconomic score (ESCS)\",\n  ylab = \"Math scores\",\n  marginal = TRUE,\n  marginal.type = \"histogram\",\n  centrality.para = \"mean\",\n  margins = \"both\",\n  title = \"Relationship between Socio-economic and Math scores\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Plot\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this plot is that it shows both the correlation between the two continous variables as well as their respective distributions, and includes important statistics like the Pearson coefficient.\nFrom the plot above, the pearson coefficient of 0.42 indicates that there is a weak positive relationship between ESCS scores and Math scores.\nThe marginal histograms for both variables also enables readers to additionally infer the distribution of these variables. For example, Math scores resemble a normal distribution, while ESCS scores resemble a left-skewed distribution."

Upon inspecting the data set, it is basically the overall mean subject scores for male and female students per school\n\n\nPrevious visualization had already analysed the differences per school. To further make it more granular by introducing gender, does not seem to add further value in terms of insights.\nWe can retain the original intent to show the granular difference in performance for the schools, by examining the actual disparity between the best and the worst schools instead.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe use of a vertically long plot to compare the scores across schools makes it visually challenging and difficult to spot differences between schools, and identify any clusters.\nSince there are 164 schools, the use of a vertically long format makes it difficult to read the Y-axis labels. There are too many schools to make identification off the Y-axis easy. This is further compounded with the additional splitting of genders for every school.\nThe distance between the X-axis, which shows the scores is too far apart from the error bars. I am unable to decipher what are the actual scores or score range for each error bar.\nThe graph is patched side by side, resulting in the Y-axis being repeated 3 times. The order of the School IDs are all the same, hence this creates additional non-data ink, that makes the graph too “busy”.\n\n\nTo revise the design of a vertically long format and re-make it to a horizontally compact visualization, by using ridge line plots to show the differences in performance only between the best and worst schools.\nTo minimize axis labels, we will only identify and plot the top & bottom 5 schools instead.\n\n\n\n\nExamining the subset used for the original plot in more detail.\n\nprint(head(pvmathgender))\n\n  CNTSCHID ST004D01T Freq   Mean  s.e.

By adding a further split into genders per school further complicates this visually.\nI will use a new compact visualization to enable the reader to quickly identify the disparity in school performance.

I will use the same sub sets to extract the top and bottom 5 School IDs for each subject.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Identify the top and bottom 5 schools\ntop_bottom_math &lt;- pvmathsch %&gt;%\n  arrange(Mean) %&gt;%\n  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %&gt;%\n  pull(CNTSCHID)\n\ntop_bottom_read &lt;- pvreadsch %&gt;%\n  arrange(Mean) %&gt;%\n  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %&gt;%\n  pull(CNTSCHID)\n\ntop_bottom_scie &lt;- pvsciesch %&gt;%\n  arrange(Mean) %&gt;%\n  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %&gt;%\n  pull(CNTSCHID)\n\n\nNext I will filter the data set and obtain PV1 student scores from the top and bottom 5 schools only.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Filter the original dataset to include only the selected schools\n\ntop_bottom_mathsch &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_math)\n\ntop_bottom_readsch &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_read)\n\ntop_bottom_sciesch &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  filter(CNTSCHID %in% top_bottom_scie)\n\n\ntop_bottom_mathsch &lt;- top_bottom_mathsch %&gt;%\n  mutate(CNTSCHID = factor(CNTSCHID, levels = top_bottom_math))\n\n\nLastly, I will use the code below to create Ridgeline plots for the top and bottom 5 schools.\n\n\nShow the code\nmath_5 &lt;- ggplot(top_bottom_mathsch, aes(x = PV1MATH, y = factor(CNTSCHID), fill = after_stat(x))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n    name = \"Math Scores\",\n    colors = c(\"red\", \"green\"),\n    limits = c(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    breaks = seq(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 5)\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,1000)) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15)  \n  )  +\n  labs(y = \"School ID\", x = NULL, title = \"Math Scores for the Top and Bottom 5 Schools\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)  \n  )\n\n\nmath_5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised plot\n\n\n\nBy narrowing our focus to compare only the top and bottom 5 schools, we are able to clearly infer the actual difference between the “best” and “worst” schools.\nThe new revised plot is now more visually compact, and allows readers to quickly examine the difference in performance between the top and bottom 5 schools.\n\n\nBesides this, we can also examine the differences in performance between Male and Female students in these top and bottom 5 schools, using the code below.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Convert ST004D01T to a factor with more meaningful level names\ntop_bottom_mathsch$ST004D01T &lt;- factor(top_bottom_mathsch$ST004D01T, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Girls\", \"Boys\"))\n\n# Plot\nmath_gender_ridges &lt;- ggplot(top_bottom_mathsch, \n                             aes(x = PV1MATH, \n                                 y = interaction(CNTSCHID, ST004D01T),  # Create interaction between school ID and gender\n                                 fill = after_stat(x))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n    name = \"Math Scores\",\n    colors = c(\"red\", \"green\"),\n    limits = c(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    breaks = seq(min(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), max(top_bottom_mathsch$PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 5)\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000)) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  labs(y = \"School ID and Gender\", x = \"Math Scores\", title = \"Math Scores for the Top and Bottom 5 Schools by Gender\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)  \n  )\n\nmath_gender_ridges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSchool IDs 70200001, 70200139 and 70200110 does not have any data on Female students and are likely a single-gender school."
